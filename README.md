# Yo, I'm Rud

I'm a 3rd-year student in AI engineering at **USTHB**.  
I’m into understanding how **maths and programming** connect — especially in optimization and problem-solving.

## What I’m interested in
- Optimization theory  
- Algorithms & search methods  
- Mathematical thinking  
- Clean software structure  
- Small experiments that teach me something ;)
